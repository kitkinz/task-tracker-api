# Task Tracker API
A RESTful API built with ASP.NET Core and EF Core for managing tasks. It connects to an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL <br />
database hosted on AWS RDS and follows clean architecture and async programming best practices.

## Tech Stack
* ASP.NET Core Web API for backend logic
* Entity Framework Core for data access
* Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL on AWS RDS for persistent storage
* Git for version control

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/kitkinz/task-tracker-api.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd TaskTrackerAPI
```
3. Restore dependencies:
```
dotnet restore
```
4. Configure your database connection. Go to `appsettings.test.json`, replace the values then rename the file to 
`appsettings.json`:
```
{
  "DbConnectionString": "Server=localhost;Port=5432;Database=database;User ID=username;Password=password"
}
```
*This project uses PostgreSQL as the database. Youâ€™re free to use any SQL database server of your choice, 
just make sure to install the corresponding NuGet packages and update the configuration settings as needed.*
5. Build then run the project:
```
dotnet build
dotnet run
```
6. Access the API documentation and test it by going to `localhost:port/docs`.
